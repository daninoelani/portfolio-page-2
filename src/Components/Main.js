          <Skills>While working as a tour leader, I was regularly tasked
          with leading groups of 5-13 travelers from varying countries,
          including safety briefings before hiking days and history
          briefings for American cities. I also handled all logistics
          for the trips and consistently searched for new things to share
          with my groups. As a divemaster intern in Malaysia, I was
          responsible for briefing divers and managing everyone underwater.
          I made the trip enjoyable and showed divers the great sea life
          while also checking on safe diving practices and controlling the
          groupâ€™s movement. I have also taught karate, dance classes,
        kickboxing and environmental education.</Skills>

          <Skills>While working with both the International Rescue Committee
            and as a resource education intern, I have spent many hours
            speaking in front of large groups of up to 60 students, often
            times with little guidance or supervision. I have managed volunteers
            for three different non-profit organizations, including recruitment,
          training, safety briefings, and coordinating tasks for the volunteers.</Skills>

          <Skills>Prior to enrolling in a fullstack bootcamp, I had spent three years
            slowly experimenting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and R Studio.
            I am proficient in ArcGIS, I have learned data science through R Studio
            and Python, and I am learning basic UX design principles to compliment
          my fullstack knowledge. </Skills>
